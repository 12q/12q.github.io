ver 1.1.9:
UX/UI update
· implemented alpha tune for making base info more visiable
· fix for predefined stabilization mode
· change video format naming
· fix for predefined FPS selection on camera change
· added double tap to gallery view, on scaled images and videos
· checked audiosession bug
· reworked a bit focus control


<!-- Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
