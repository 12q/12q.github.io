Hello,

Welcome to the xZoom
Become more Pro about your camera.

Here you will know about direct camera access, camera video formats,
set the stabilization modes, how to control the lens focus
and how does look like the maximum digital zoom on your camera.

You can get the physical camera access to each one of those (if you have more then one)
 · Portrait (front camera)
 · Telephoto (has optical zoom)
 · Wide (your default camera)
 · Ultra-Wide (has ultra-wide angel)
 
By default your camera app operates with the logical camera device that keeps all your physical camera device into one  (we call it builtInTripleCamera, or builtInDualCamera if you have only two back cameras).

So when you making zoom in from ×0.5 to ×5.0, right behind the scene the iPhone switching from Ultra-Wide to Wide cameras, then from Wide to Telephoto. And you don't recognise the camera switch. That's why it's made if for.

But what if you need to get strait access to your physical camera device?
Let's imagine you need to test you Wide camera sensor with 48MP with peak zoom values.
Right, you need the direct camera access.

Well, we get it. What's next?

Then you may choose the video format that reflects the most to your needs.
It could be the:
